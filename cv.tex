\section{Summary}
I am a software developer passionate by technology since I am ten years old.
I specialize in platform development since 2014 on Android related products with focus on smart-watches.
I shine in learning and sharing technical knowledge.
I was born in the Netherlands then got my Master Degree in France.
Therefore I speak fluent English, French and Dutch.
