\section{Summary}
I am a software developer and passionated by technology since I was ten years old.
I do platform development since 2014 on Android related products, with focus on smart-watches.
I shine in learning and sharing technical knowledge.
I was born in the Netherlands then got my Master Degree in France.
Therefore I speak fluent English, French and Dutch.

\section{Key accomplishments}
\begin{cvcolumns}
  \cvcolumn{Audio software stack}{%
    On Android Wear based products, I was the audio software stack owner.
    I have developed and debugged several places in the software stack including DSP firmware, Linux kernel drivers, Audio HALs and apps (java) level.
  }
\end{cvcolumns}
\begin{cvcolumns}
  \cvcolumn{Manufacturing OS design/implementation}{%
    Traveled to China for pre-mass production, on-site troubleshooting and support.
    Developed Intel wearable Manufacturing OS, for hardware testing on the production line.
  }
  \cvcolumn{Platform bring-up}{%
    Traveled to the Bay Area for a week for a hard-ware bring-up. Audio stack (with codec, speakers, four microphones) was up in two days and had three more days to make the camera work.

\section{Work history}
\cventry{February, 2017 -- present}{Linux/Android R\&D for Intel New Device Group}{CELAD}
{San Francisco Bay Area}{USA}
{
  I work on several Android wear products with Intel inside, as a software developer and integrator.
  I follow each product, from the early schematics to the end-user software releases.
  This role is a follows-up from my role in Toulouse.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Android/Linux drivers, Android Framework / HALs \& Apps (java)
        \item Production line support, system debugging, hardware bring-ups
        \item C, C++, Java, Git, Python, XML, Bash, Android build system
    \end{itemize}
}

\cventry{September, 2014 -- January, 2017}{Linux/Android R\&D for Intel New Device Group}{CELAD}
{Toulouse}{France}
{
  Worked on the audio stack for Android wear (device implementation). I implemented a low-power audio playback architecture (A2DP) for some products, and developed the machine driver for the microphone.
  During these 3 years, I also developed a Manufacturing OS, which was used for mass production and quality screening.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Android/Linux drivers, Android Framework / HALs
        \item Production line support, system debugging, hardware bring-ups
        \item Android/Linux drivers (ASoC framework) and DSP Firmware
        \item Android audio HAL, AudioFlinger, AudioPolicy
        \item C, C++, Git, Python, XML, Bash, Android build system
    \end{itemize}
}

\cventry{April, 2014 -- August, 2014}{Internship: Opensource audio HAL component}{CELAD}
{Toulouse}{France}
{
  Worked on open-sourcing the Parameter-Framework, a major component of Intel's Android Audio HAL.
  This component is now part of Android AOSP (/external/parameter-framework/)
}

\cventry{May, 2013 -- August, 2013}{Internship: embedded and web development}{24green}
{Vlaardingen}{The Netherlands}
{
  Developed a web (REST) API which handles climate control functions in green-houses.
  This API was then illustrated by example apps, one for Android and one web-based.
  This was in a Windows Embedded environment, with C\# (for back-end) and HTML/CSS/javascript + java for the example apps
}

\cventry{April, 2012 -- July, 2012}{Internship: linux kernel development}{IRIT}
{UPS Toulouse}{France}
{
  Linux kernel development around performance counters and other statistics about the hardware.
  These were inputs to algorithms the research lab simulated to adjust the CPU frequency.
  After development I performed some tests on a French grid computing network, Grid'5000.
}
